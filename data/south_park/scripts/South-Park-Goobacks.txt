               [Interstate 285 looking north, twilight fading to night. There 
               are two lanes on either side of the highway, with a grass median 
               in between. A Snacky Cakes truck rolls by. Tumbleweeds begin 
               to roll. A few seconds later, the highway sign begins to shake 
               violently and then crackle with lightning. The camera pans to 
               the right and more lightning is seen until a sphere of energy 
               with a doorway appears. More tumbleweeds roll by. A flash of 
               light follows, and an alien steps forth from the sphere. He looks 
               around and mumbles something. He walks towards the highway, looking 
               around all the while. A car comes up quick on him and he freezes 
               in the headlights for a while, then jumps out of the way as a 
               Busy Beavers Moving Company truck barrels past him. A car comes 
               up on him on the other side of the highway. He gets up quickly 
               and steps out of the way. Traffic picks up and the alien dodges 
               all the vehicles until a car almost runs him over. The car brakes 
               and tips him over.]
 
               [South Park, next day. The boys approach a house, which has more 
               snow on it than usual in South Park, especially along the windows. 
               Indeed, looks like the town has just had a snow storm overnight. 
               Each of the boys carries a shovel. Stan rings the bell. A woman 
               answers.]
 
                                     WOMAN
                         Yes?

                                     CARTMAN
                          Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town 
                         and offering snow-shoveling service. 
                         Would you like your driveway and sidewalk 
                         shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
 
                         
                                     WOMAN
                         Oh well, I certainly could use some 
                         little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand 
                         dollars seems a little steep. How about 
                         ten dollars?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of 
                         that tight grip you have on my balls! 
                         Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, 
                         ma'am!
 
                                     WOMAN
                         How about fifteen dollars?

                                     CARTMAN
                         It's a deal! All right, guys, let's 
                         get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally 
                         awesome. Craig crapped his pants when 
                         he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' 
                         on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool. 
                          No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is 
                         so weak.  What?
 
                                     KYLE
                         You've been on your fucking phone since 
                         we started!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Dude, I'm takin' a break.

                                     KYLE
                         A break from what?! You haven't done 
                         anything!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Kyle, how many times do we have to go 
                         through this? I'm the negotiator. I 
                         negotiate our price with the customers.
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                         All you ever do is talk about your balls!
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         It works, doesn't it? Did I not just 
                         get us an extra five bucks?
 
                                     KYLE
                         If you want your share of the money, 
                         then you're gonna shovel snow like the 
                         rest of us!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' 
                         Jew! I will kick your ass!
 
               [Moments later the doorbell rings again. This time the camera 
               is in the house looking at the door from an angle. The woman 
               approaches and opens the door. The boys are shown, with Cartman 
               keeping his now-bloody nose from oozing any more blood]
 
                                     STAN
                         Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?
 
                         
                                     WOMAN
                         Oh goodness, what happened?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Shoveling accident.

                                     WOMAN
                         Oooh no, come on inside.  Wait right 
                         here, I'll be right back. 
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, 
                         Kyle, or I'd totally let you have it.
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.
 
                         
                                     NEWS ANNOUNCER
                         This is breaking news. Here's Anchorman 
                         Aaron Brown. 
 
                                     AARON BROWN
                          Incredible, absolutely amazing news 
                         today. A man from the future has come 
                         back in time and is in a government 
                         hospital after being hit by a car.
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         Whoa.

                                     AARON BROWN
                         Christina Naylon has more.

                                     CHRISTINA NAYLON
                          The news is incredible, Aaron. Experts 
                         and scientists have been with the man 
                         from the future for several hours now, 
                         and have been able to learn that he 
                         is from the year 3045. His condition 
                         is stable, and speculation continues 
                         as to why he has come. Has he come to 
                         deliver a cure for cancer? Or to fix 
                         something wrong with the past?
 
                                     AARON BROWN
                         Have to interrupt you there, Christina. 
                         Apparently, Brad Morgan is inside the 
                         base with breaking news. Brad?
 
                                     BRAD MORGAN
                          Aaron, the scientists have been able 
                         to communicate further and have uncovered 
                         that the man from one thousand years 
                         in the future has come to our time... 
                         looking for work. Now, uh he has said 
                         that the future is so overwhelmingly 
                         overpopulated that there are simply 
                         no jobs in his time, and so he built 
                         a time portal and has come back to 21st 
                         century America, uh to find a job here.
 
                         
                                     AARON BROWN
                         Heheh, it's absolutely astounding. He 
                         came back here for work?
 
                                     BRAD MORGAN
                         Huh... that's right, Aaron. Hi-his plan 
                         is to get a job here, in our time, so 
                         that he can put the money he earns into 
                         a savings account, uh, which will earn 
                         interest, and by the year 3045 be worth 
                         billions of dollars, uh which of course 
                         in the future will be worth only hundres 
                         of dollars, but uh enough, he says, 
                         to feed his family.
 
                                     AARON BROWN
                         And now I understand we're going to 
                         Harrison Moore, uh, for an explanation 
                         on how the time portal works. Harrison?
 
                         
                                     HARRISON MOORE
                          Aaron, I'm standing at the time border 
                         which scientists say follow Terminator 
                         rules. That is, it's one way only and 
                         you can't go back. This is in contrast, 
                         say, to Back To The Future rules, where 
                         back and forth is possible, and of course, 
                         Timerider rules, which are just plain 
                         silly. Anyway, it appears that the man 
                         from the future is here to stay.
 
               [Later, Stan returns home. He enters with his shovel]

                                     STAN
                         Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a 
                         man from the future!
 
                                     RANDY
                         We know, Stanley. We've been watching.
 
                         
                                     AARON BROWN
                         If you're just joining us, a man from 
                         over two thousand years into the future 
                         has come through a one-way time portal 
                         looking for work. Uh, the President 
                         is expected to give an announcement 
                         at any time.
 
                                     HARRISON MOORE
                         Breaking news here at the time portal, 
                         Aaron. It appears that another person 
                         from the future has just arrived!  It 
                         looks as if the job at Wendy's did work 
                         for the original immigrant; this second 
                         arrivee claims that man's family is 
                         now much better off, and wishes the 
                         same for his family.
 
               [Stan's house, night. Sharon puts Stan to bed and tucks him in.]
 
               
                                     SHARON
                         There you go. All set, sweetie?

                                     STAN
                         Mom, can we go try to see the people 
                         from the future? I have a bunch of questions 
                         I wanna ask 'em.
 
                                     SHARON
                         I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's 
                         pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you 
                         just get some sleep.  You've had a busy 
                         day.  Goodnight, sweetie.
 
                                     STAN
                         Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the 
                         future. How cool.
 
               [Interstate 285 looking north, twilight fading to night. The 
               highway sign begins to shake violently and then crackle with 
               lightning. The camera pans to the right and more lightning is 
               seen until it reaches the portal. A flash of light follows, and 
               an alien steps forth from the sphere. Another flash brings forth 
               another alien. Another flash brings forth a third alien. Another 
               flash brings forth his wife, another flash brings forth their 
               daughter, and another flash brings forth their son. Another flash 
               brings forth another alien. They head for the highway, which 
               is busy now. They all make their way across, avoiding being struck 
               as they cross the lanes]
 
               [South Park, day. The boys once agani make their rounds as shovelers 
               and stop at a house. Stan rings the doorbell, the door opens, 
               and a different woman greets them]
 
                                     WOMAN 2
                         Yes?

                                     STAN
                         Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling 
                         service again today?
 
                                     MRS. LANDIS
                         Ooo, oh dear, I'm sorry boys, but I've 
                         already hired someone else to do it.

                         Still more immigrants from the future 
                         arrived at the time border today, some 
                         even bringing their entire families. 
                         the purplish goo that they have on their 
                         bodies when they arrive is an ectoplasmic 
                         side effect of the time-travel process. 
                         This is all giving scientists a great 
                         opportunity to learn even more about 
                         American life in the future. Chris Holt

                          Yes, there are incredible things we're 
                         learning about Americans in the future, 
                         Aaron. Eh it appears that in the future, 
                         Americans have evolved into a hairless 
                         uniform mix of all races. They are all 
                         one color, which is a yellowy light-brownish 
                         whitish color. Uh it seems race is no 
                         longer an issue in the future, because 
                         all ethnicities have mixed into one. 
                         Perhaps most interesting is how this 
                         has affected their language. The people 
                         in the future speak a complete mix of 
                         English, Chinese, Turkish and, indeed, 
                         all world languages, which sounds something 
                         like this:  Back to you, Aaron.

                         Apparently the people from the future 
                         are having a pretty easy time finding 
                         work. Since they offer to work for such 
                         low wages, they're being hired all over 
                         America.

                         us, who have everything sooo good, to 
                         judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?!

                         goobacks, you might just wanna stop

                         All right, children, the school board 
                         has mandated that I must now teach class 
                         in both present-day English and Futurespeak.

                         So, with that in mind, let's continue 
                         our lessons on verbs. Remember that 
                         there are transitive verbs such as  
                         "The boy threw the red ball," which 
                         in Futurespeak of course, is  Everyone 
                         say it with me?  Aaand there are intransitive 
                         verbs, such as  "The 11:15 bus from 
                         Denver arrived twelve hours late." Or 
                         in Futurespeak, "Vvut."

                         future who knows geology and he offered 
                         to work for next to nothing. Uh, this 
                         is Mr. Glughgogawk.

                         Breaking news at the time border. We 
                         go now live to Harrison Moore.
 
                                     HARRISON MOORE
                         Aaron, I'm standing at the time border 
                         where some kind of mass protest has 
                         broken out.  Hundreds of men who have 
                         lost their jobs to time immigrants are 
                         here having sex with one another.  These 
                         men have apparently sucked and screwed 
                         their way across the state and are now 
                         here at the time border trying to get 
                         national attention. These unemployed 
                         men have been having sex for several 
                         days. Joining me is their spokesperson, 
                         Randy Marsh.  Mr. Marsh, what exactly 
                         are you trying to accomplish?
 
                                     RANDY
                         We're doing the only thing we can do. 
                         If our government is just gonna let 
                         anybody into our time who wants to come, 
                         then we have to take matters into our 
                         own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone 
                         gay so that there are no future humans! 
                         Present-day America Number One!
 
                                     DARRYL WEATHERS
                         Yeah America! 

                                     MAN 8
                         Take our jobs!

                                     HARRISON MOORE
                         Do you really think you can get enough 
                         people to turn gay to destroy the future 
                         of humanity?
 
                                     RANDY
                         All we can do is try, Harrison.

                                     DOUCHE
                          Trying to stop immigration is intolerant 
                         and ignorant. Those immigrants have 
                         a right to pursue happiness.
 
                                     HARRISON MOORE
                          Young man, what do you think about 
                         all this?
 
                                     STAN
                         I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks 
                         because they're no different from us. 
                          They're just humans trying to make 
                         their lives better. Look, it sucks that 
                         the immigrants' time is so crappy, but 
                         the cold hard truth is that if we let 
                         them all come back to our time, then 
                         it's just gonna make our time crappy 
                         too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to 
                         stop the future from happening, but 
                         making the future better. 
 
                                     MAN 9
                          Huh?

                                     STAN
                         I mean, maybe if we all commit right 
                         now to working toward a better future, 
                         then, then the future won't be so bad, 
                         and, these immigrants won't need to 
                         come back here looking for work.
 
                                     MAN 10
                          Hey. He's right. If we build for a 
                         better future, the immigrants will stay 
                         there.
 
                                     MAN 11
                         Yeah. We've got to start working towards 
                         a brighter tomorrow.
