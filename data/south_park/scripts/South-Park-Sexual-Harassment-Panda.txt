                         Okay, chlidren. Let's take our seats. 
                         We have something very important to 
                         discuss. Due to recent events around 
                         the country I've been instructed to 
                         teach you all about sexual harassment 
                         in school.

                         Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment 
                         means?  Yes, Eric?

                         with a lady friend, and some other guy 
                         comes up and tickles your balls from 
                         behind.

                         about! The school board has sent over 
                         a special guest to teach us all about 
                         sexual harassment in schools. Please

               Hi, boys and girls. [the class says nothing]

                          Did you know that when one little panda 
                         pulls on another little panda's underwear, 
                         that's sexual harassment? That makes 
                         me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda

                          And when one little panda puts his 
                         furry little willy in another panda's 
                         ear, that makes me a very sad panda. 
                          Now, I'm going to pass out these booklets, 
                         and we're going to go through each and

                         Answer the question. Did you know that 
                         sexual harassment was going on in the 
                         classroom?

                         board have been thinking, and, we've 
                         decided that perhaps a "panda" isn't 
                         the best way to explain sexual harassment 
                         to children.

                         a panda doesn't really have anything 
                         to do with... sexual harassment.  At all.

                         As sexual harassment lawsuits increase 
                         all over the state, the mother of all 
                         trials is set to begin. The sexual harassment 
                         case of Everyone vs. Everyone begins 
                         tomorrow. No matter what the outcome, 
                         the public schools are sure to lose 
                         at least a whopping $30 million. Representing 
                         the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski, 
                         the lawyer from South Park who plans 
                         to make quite a commission. Representing 
                         the side of Everyone Else is Gerald

                         things look very bright for Kyle's dad. 
                         Personally, I think Kyle's dad is just 
                         a whore, taking advantage of everyone

                         Listen to me: when you sue somebody, 
                         it hurts everyone. You sue for money, 
                         but where do you think that money comes 
                         from? From the schools, from taxes, 
                         from the state. From you.  There's no 
                         such thing as free money. When you sue 
                         somebody, you take money away from parks 
                         and schools and charities, and put it 
                         in your own pocket. And that makes me 
                         a sa-a-a-a-ad panda.

                         I'm a really sad panda. I didn't know 
                         we were doing all that damage. This 
                         is all that damn lawyer's fault! 
 
                         
                                     MAN 2
                          Yeah! Let's sue the lawyer!

                          Yeah!

                         Boy, what a great message he has! When 
                         you sue people, you just end up causing 
                         a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, 
                         I've really learned something today. 
                         All I could see was the millions of 
                         dollars coming to me and I didn't care 
                         about where the money came from. Well, 
                         I'm no longer doing sexual harassment 
                         lawsuits in schools! They're too vague 
                         and two easily corruptible. Thank you, 
                         Sexual Harassment Panda!

                         Hello, cubs. I'm "Don't Sue People" 
                         Panda, with an important message for 
                         you! Lawsuits damage our society. I 
                         know it's tempting to make money, but 
                         just remember: that money has to come 
                         from somewhere. And usually, it ends 
                         up hurting a lot of innocent people. 
                         So, until next time, don't let frivolous 
                         sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our 
                         schools. Good-bye now.
