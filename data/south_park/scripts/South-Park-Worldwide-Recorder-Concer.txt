                         was working on his fingering with his 
                         mom all night long.

                         Uh, there's been a terrible flood in 
                         Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's 
                         event is being moved to Arkansas.

                         Eh, the trip shouldn't take any longer, 
                         but I'll hand out these updated contact 
                         sheets so that your parents will know 
                         where you are, m'kay?

                         Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a 
                         second?

                         Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. 
                         Somebody's gonna have to fill in for 
                         me.

                         in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas?

                          Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents 
                         live theremy  ...father still lives there.

                         Well, don't you want to see them?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         I haven't seen my father for 23 years.

                         Uh, perhaps you should sit down, Mr. 
                         Garrison, m'kay?  Mr. Garrison, I know 
                         this is very difficult, m'kay, but I 
                         must ask: is there a history of sexual 
                         abuse in your family?
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         ...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. 
                         He... he molested me.

                         Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's 
                         a paraplegic, but it didn't

                         M'kay, eh, and your father? He molested 
                         you when you were a boy?  Mr. Garrison, 
                         I think, when we get to Arkansas, you 
                         need to see your father. You need to 
                         face this demon in your closet, m'kay?
 
                         
                                     MR. GARRISON
                          Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your 
                         bastard trip and just- don't look at 
                         me!

                         It depends, uh- how big a gun are we

                         I think if someone said, "Have sex with

                         If a killer put a knife to my throat, 
                         and said, "Have sex with your father 
                         or else I'm gonna kill your mother while

                         That's right.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         M-m-m.  Oh, well, thank you!  You know, 
                         it's funny: you kiss just like my dad. 
                          Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly 
                         has been a great trip. Let's head home.
 
                         
                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Which way should we go?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Second star to the right, and straight 
                         on 'til morning.
