                         Okay, children, it's Friday, and you 
                         know what that means for PE class. We're 
                         gonna play dodgeball!

                         We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.

                          Uuh. Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. 
                         I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball.

                         from that team is gonna try to bean 
                         a kid on our team in the head with a 
                         big red ball.

                         If the ball hits you, you're out, but 
                         if you catch the ball, he's out, and 
                         the last team to still have anybody 
                         standing wins.

                         Stan? Has anybody actually seen the

                         up on your poor nurse's condition, and 
                         it is nothing to be made fun of. It's

                         babies are born, they're born as twins. 
                         But sometimes the twins get hooked together, 
                         and they're born as Siamese twins.

                         But sometimes, after the Siamese twins 
                         are joined together, one of the twins 
                         dies before birth. The living baby is 
                         born with the dead baby still attached. 
                          Sometimes, this dead twin is inside 
                         the living person, so even you could 
                         have a dead twin inside you and not

                         Last year's national champions were 
                         the Austin Pirates. They played China 
                         for the world championship. Only four 
                         of them came back alive. Chinese dodgeball 
                         players aren't like us.

                         I just realized something. I have been 
                         obsessed, and obsession isn't good. 
                          If we had won the world championship, 
                         what then?  It would only be a bigger 
                         letdown the nest year if we didn't win! 
                         Our lives would have to revolve around 
                         dodgeball. Our lives were fine before! 
                          Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all 
                         go to my head. Can you ever forgive 
                         me?  Come on, forget this stupid game! 
                         Let's go home.

                         on my handicap all week long.  Look,

                         ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun 
                         of like all the rest of you do to each
