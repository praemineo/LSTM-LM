                         Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing 
                         card!  You can deny it, or cover it 
                         up.

                         Dude, I don't understand this game at 
                         all.

                         Curtis" funtime game. You have to decide 
                         if you deny it or cover it up.
 
                                     STAN
                         Um, deny it?

                          Hello, I'm Bill Curtis. Many believe 
                         that the U.S. Government... covered it 
                         up. I'm Bill Curtis.

                         Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... 
                         a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.

                         Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle 
                         AIDS.

                          and 800 points.

                         having another baby. Wouldn't you like 
                         to have another brother or sister?

                         is already on welfare, and now they're 
                         gonna bring another kid into the world. 
                         Poor people are turning out babies, 
                         adding to the overpopulation, and they're 
                         expecting me to pay for it with my tax 
                         dollars.

                         I've gotta start hanging out with friends 
                         that are a little more intelligent, 
                         and understand ...politics and stuff. 
                         It's just that... I'm up on this level 
                         up here , and all my friends are down

                         want love from us. We need a poster

                         a beautiful and wonderful thing and
