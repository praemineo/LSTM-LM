                          A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? 
                         No, let me guess: It's a Froagman Jay 
                         doll! No wait, I know! It's a police 
                         power chopper!

                         It's a new way to learn how to read 
                         and spell. And it comes with everything 
                         you need to help win that speling bee.

                         level 1. I will read the sounds and 
                         the monkey will help keep the beat. 
                          If your monkey arrived in the box dead, 
                         call 1-800-555-4500 to get a new monkey. 
                         Ready? Let's begin. 
 
               The learning monkey is here to say

               That reading is easy and it's okay.

               [Liane starts swaying like a metronome]

               Work with the monkey and you will learn

               To spell hard words, like "morbid" and "burn."

               Start with Card 1. [Liane holds it up] Ready? Begin! [glissant]

               then turns to Cartman. One more beat...]

                         I'm sorry, son. There's nothing we can 
                         do to stop those bullies. We have to 
                         pull you out of public school.

               [South Park Elementary, night. It's Friday and the kids are gathering 
               in the gym for the dance. Mark is already in the crowd, but the 
               time is not yet. There isn't much to dance to, but kids dance 
               anyway. Wendy and Bebe hop back and forth. Tweek dances as well. 
               Pip is dancing in the background. Jordan and Clyde, Token and 
               the redhead, Kevin, Terrence and Fosse, and the tattered kid

                         Where are my children?! I'm taking them 
                         out of this God-forsaken place!
 
                                     MARK
                          Calm down, pap치!  Everything is all 
                         right.  You see, I've learned something 
                         today. Public schools may be a bit lacking 
                         in education, but it's the main place 
                         where children learn all of their social 
                         skills. You can't teach a child social 
                         skills. They have to learn them themselves. 
                         And the only place to do that is on 
                         the playground, in the cafeteria, and 
                         so on.  Don't you see, pap치? That's 
                         what happened to your daughter. You 
                         tried so hard to keep her from anythng 
                         sexual, and now look at her. She's a 
                         God-damned whore, pap치.

                         I know letting your kids out into the 
                         world is scary. I know you wish nothing 
                         bad would ever happen to us. But bad 
                         things will happen, and we have to start 
                         learning now how to deal with those 
                         things.

                         childdren. If it's what you want, you 
                         can start going to public school.
