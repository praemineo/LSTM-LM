               [Stan and the boys are in the Marsh garage belting out tunes, 
               but their musical styles are scattered. Cartman sings lead, Stan 
               and Kyle on are guitars, Kenny is on the drums]
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         God damnit! 

                                     RANDY
                          Stan, are you okay?

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our 
                         band. 
 
                                     RANDY
                         Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese 
                         people were having their intestines 
                         pulled out through their mouths. 
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                          Heheheheheh heheheheheh.

                                     KYLE
                         He's right, dude. We have to define 
                         our style if we're ever going to make 
                         a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion 
                         guy, but Kenny's background is more 
                         Latin Jazz.

                         (What? Is it?)

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B 
                         oriented. 
 
                                     KYLE
                         I think out band better buy a whole 
                         bunch of music CDs to listen to for 
                         inspiration.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's 
                         it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you 
                         see?
 
                                     STAN
                         See what?

                                     CARTAMN
                          Our band should play Christian rock! 
                         
 
                                     KYLE
                         Christian rock?!

                                     CARTMAN
                          Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest 
                         music in the world, right? If we just 
                         play songs about how much we love Jesus, 
                         all the Christiand will buy our crap!
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                         That's a retarded idea, Cartman!

                                     CARTMAN
                          It worked for Creed!

                                     STAN
                         I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian 
                         rock band!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          You just start that way, Stan, then 
                         you cross over. It's genious!
 
                                     KYLE
                          Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! 
                         You're not serious and you're a detriment 
                         to the band!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that 
                         if I start a Christian rock band that 
                         I can get a platinum album before you 
                         guys do!
 
                                     KYLE
                         You're on, fat boy!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have 
                         a platinum album wins! Go! 
 
                                     KYLE
                          What a stupid asshole!

                         Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta 
                         make a platinum album before Kyle!

                         Butters! Get your drum set and meet 
                         me at my house! We have to make a platinum 
                         album! Hurry, Butters!

                         No time to waste! Platinum album! Must 
                         beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar 
                         out of your basement and meet me over 
                         at my house!

                         What?! We don't have a bass guitar.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                          Your family's black, Token! There's 
                         bound to be a bass guitar in your basement 
                         somewhere!

                         Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You 
                         must have some... ih-inspiration.

                         he loses his ten dollars to me.

                          Hey, there was a bass guitar in my 
                         basement.

                         I told you, Token.

                         So, what are we doing?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Gentlemen, we are about to embark on 
                         the most amazing, life-affirming, financially-windfalling 
                         experiences of our young lives.

                         Wow!

                                     CARTMAN
                         We are going to start... a Christian 
                         rock band.

                         Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and 
                         you'll regret it the rest of your life! 
                         Christians have a built-in audience 
                         of over one hundred and eighty million 
                         Americans! If each one of them buys 
                         just one of our albums at twelve dollars 
                         and ninety-five cents that would be-

                         Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.

                         to go in. We need to go down to the 
                         mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen 
                         to so we can define our sound.

                         easy. All we have to do to make Christian

                         add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we 
                         have to do is cross out words like "baby" 
                         and "Darling" and replace them with 
                          Jesus. All right, Butters, give me

                          We just have one question, though. 
                         We were looking over some of your lyrics, 
                         uh... "I want to walk hand-in-hand with 
                         Jesus on a private beach for two./I 
                         want him to nibble on my ear and say 
                         'I'm here for you.'" Ih it seams you 
                         really love Christ.

                         my life done anything just for the money!

                         You mean to tell me I could never get 
                         a platinum album with a Christian rock 
                         band?!

                         No, but you can go double myrrh.

                                     MICHAEL COLLINS
                          Oh, please don't take the Lord's Name 
                         in vain.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Who cares?! I can never win my bet because 
                         you stupid assholes don't give out platinum 
                         albums!
 
                                     MICHAEL COLLINS
                         But you spread the Word of the Lord. 
                         You've brought faith in Jesus.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         OH, FUCK JESUS!!

                         Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't 
                         say the F-word about-uh Jesus.

                         Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band.

                                     CARTMAN
                          Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could 
                         never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! 
                         Fuck Jesus! 
 
                                     A MAN
                         My ears are bleeding!

                         audience!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole!
