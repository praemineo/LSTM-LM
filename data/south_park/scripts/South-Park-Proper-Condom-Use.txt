                         graders showed us how to do it.  Red 
                         rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh

                         I had no idea dogs made milk; do it 
                         again.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once 
                         every few hours. It doesn't work if 
                         you beat off the dog again right away.

                                     CARTMAN
                          That's what it's called when you milk 
                         a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys 
                         know anything?
 
                                     STAN
                         Wow, you learned all this from the fifth 
                         graders?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, 
                         so they showed us how to do it-hey come 
                         here, dog. Dog, come here!

                         book. I agree with what Bob and Linda 
                         said-

                         Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and

                         Later, sweetie.  Anyway, I found myself 
                         enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.

                          Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence: 
                          "Cannery Row in Monterey in California-" 
                          "-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..."

                         dog was-ss sexual.

                         Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want 
                         a chance to speak, but we have to talk 
                         one at a time.

                          Look, our kids are learning sexual 
                         things on the street and on television. 
                         There's no way we can stop it. The schools 
                         have to teach them sexual education 
                         at a younger age.

                         School policy has been to teach sexual 
                         education later. In the fifth grade.

                         Look, parents. Do you really want your 
                         children learning about sex? Part of 
                         the fun of being a kid is being naive! 
                         Let them be kids for a while.

                         Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we 
                         have to face facts: Children in America 
                         are having sex at younger and younger 
                         ages. STDs are affecting younger and 
                         younger kids all the time. The only 
                         way we can combat that is by educating 
                         children before they have sex.
 
                                     CHEF
                         The first thing that kids learn about 
                         sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic 
                         about STDs.

                          No, she's right! With all the teen 
                         pregnancies that are out today, I think

                         that some of you think this is very 
                         funny. Words like "penis" and "vagina."

                         male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the 
                         testes and the scrotum.  STOP that,

                         gonna get a referral!  M'kay. Now, in

                         his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh...

                         get a sexually transmitted disease from 
                         them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that

                         a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand 
                         more tomorrow! And the reason is that 
                         you girls wake up in the morning and 
                         say, "It's not going to happen to me." 
                         You say, "Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens 
                         to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but 
                         not here in Colorado." WRONG!  Gonorrhea,

                         hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes 
                         on and on! These are serious diseases! 
                         They have serious consequences!  You 
                         think that sex is about fun and games 
                         and love?  Wrong! Sex is about disease!

                         the basics, you know, uh with the boys, 
                         but I uh... eh just wanted to see what 
                         else you were teaching the girls, in 
                         case I... "missed" anything.

                         are good and scared of the consequences. 
                         We have to teach them that diseases 
                         are possible even with just oral sex.

                         Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat 
                         of a virgin.  But I'm not ashamed of 
                         it!  I wasn't sought after much in high 
                         school or college.  I was made fun of 
                         most of my life for having such large 
                         glasses.  The only boyfriend I ever 
                         had was this attractive popular boy 
                         named Steven Garrett. I liked him very 
                         much, but I... found out that he was 
                         dating me because he lost a bet on the 
                         Superbowl. The loser had to go out with 
                         me for three days.

                         People can be very cruel. Anyway, I 
                         know it's hard to understand.
 
                                     COUNSELOR MACKEY
                         Ah actually I understand perfectly. 
                         I... I wasn't exactly the captain of 
                         the football team, either, huh huh, 
                         hehehuh,  anyhow  And then as I got 
                         older my... my head just sorta seemed 
                         to get bigger while the rest of my body 
                         stayed the same. That's how I got my 
                         nickname in college.

                         and fourd it possible to ever ask a 
                         woman out, mm, hm mm.

                         as sexually unappealing as me.

                         Teachers, I have some bad news. Last 
                         night I received a phone call from the 
                         local pharmacist. Apparently, almost 
                         all of our fourth graders are sexually 
                         active. And now that we've scared them 
                         a little they're buying condoms to use.

                         I knew it! Well, at least we scared 
                         them enough to protect themselves. But 
                         now maybe you'll believe me when I say 
                         that we need to be teaching even younger 
                         than fourth grade.

                         Okay, children, who can tell me what 
                         a condom is?  Yes, Jenny?
 
                                     JENNY
                         It flies around and it's endangered.
 
                         
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         That's a con-dor, Jenny. Con-dor.  Con-doms 
                         are what we use to stop the spread of 
                         STDs.  Yes, Filmore?

                         Can we do fingerpaint?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids 
                         wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a 
                         nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now 
                         pay attention, alright? I'm going to 
                         show you the proper way to put on a 
                         condom.  First of all you remove the 
                         condom from its package.  Then you find 
                         which way the condom rolls out.  Put 
                         it in your mouth...  And apply.  And 
                         it's as simple as that. Any questions?

                         Alright girls. Yesterday we went over 
                         the myriad of diseases you can get from 
                         boys, but today we're going to talk 
                         about the most horrible they can give 
                         you of all.  PREGNANCY!  That's right, 
                         since you girls have decided to be sexually 
                         active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time 
                         high! You seem to think it's gonna be 
                         fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's 
                         watch a little video, shall we?!

                         of pain. Now we can see the crown of 
                         the baby's head, stretching the vaginal

                         done yet.

                         part, m'kay.
 
               Ms. Choksondik	Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated 
               at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the... [looks at

                         Look: Schools are teaching condom use 
                         to younger and younger students each 
                         say! But sex isn't something that should 
                         be taught in textbooks and diagrams. 
                         Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs 
                         to be taught by family. I know it can 
                         be hard, parents, but if you leave it 
                         up to the schools to teach sex to kids, 
                         you don't know who they're learning 
                         it from. It could be from someone who 
                         doesn't know,  someone who has a bad 
                         opinion of it,  or even a complete pervert.

                         He's right. I never knew how special

                         time to start having sex is...  17.

                         diseases, huh, Wendy?
