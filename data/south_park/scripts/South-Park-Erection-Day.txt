                                     COUNSELOR MACKEY
                         N'kay, kids, as your counselor, I know 
                         it can sometimes be difficult to talk 
                         about subjects like drugs and sex and 
                         alcohol, m'kay? So, as you remember, 
                         last week I told you to write down any 
                         difficult questions you had and put 
                         them in this box anonymously so we could 
                         discuss in class, m'kay? I got a lot 
                         o' responses, so let's read some aloud. 
                          "Mr. Mackey is gay."  Okay kids, that 
                         is not funny! Unkay?! This box is supposed 
                         to be used for serious questions! About, 
                         about serious issues! M'kay, let's let's 
                         stop the tomfoolery!  M'kay, this looks 
                         like a real one here.  "Dear Mr. Mackey, 
                         you are gay."  All right, all right. 
                         That's enough, kids. Let's quiet down 
                         and try to be mature, 'kay?  Uh here 
                         we go. Okay, "Mr. Mackey, sometimes 
                         my parents hit me, and you are gay." 
                          Damnit, is there not one serious question 
                         in here?!  "Mr. Mackey is gay, Mr. Mackey 
                         is gay"  Okay, here.  I am a boy at 
                         South Park Elementary. Sometimes, when 
                         I'm sitting in class, my penis becomes 
                         hard for no reason. What should I do? 
                          All right kids, all right kids, that's 
                         enough!  If you all can't be serious 
                         about the question box,  then we'll 
                         just do drug identification exercises, 
                         unkay?!
 
                                     CLASS
                         Awwwww!

                         up here and write down the names of 
                         two narcotics?

                         Uh no, that that's okay, Mr. Mackey.

                         Jimmy, I'm not asking you, I'm telling 
                         you!
 
                                     JIMMY

                         someone else, um. Eric, why don't you 
                         come up here?

                         doesn't have to do it?!

                         Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching 
                         a tent right now.

                         Jimmy, we understand you're getting 
                         erections in the classroom.
 
                                     JIMMY
                          What? Uh who told you that?

                         of. But we know it's something you might 
                         have a hard time talking about. Get 
                         it? A hard time. So, we took your counselor's

                         us all talk about this.

                          Hey Jimmy, I'm Doctor Pal. That's because 
                         I'm a doctor, but I'm also your pal. 
                         Are we cool?

                         A lot of times parents call me in because 
                         I can relate to younger kids. I'm I'm 
                         down, I'm dope, you dig? Now, I understand 
                         you have some concerns about erections. 
                          "Oops, can't say erection in front 
                         of the parents right. Oh God, I feel 
                         so weird" huh?

                         Jimmy, there's nothing weird about random 
                         erections. Almost every boy goes through 
                         a phase where his penis becomes hard... 
                         for no particular reason. It's just 
                         part of grwoing up. Growing up? Growing 
                         out is more like it.

                         Jimmy, as you get older your body goes 
                         through a lot of changes. Certain hormones 
                         start to release as your whole reproductive 
                         system begins to awaken, and so, if 
                         you like, we can take off our shirts 
                         and kiss.

                                     DOCTOR PAL
                         Oh, hey, nothin', you see? See, that 
                         set you off on a different tangent, 
                         got you thinkin' a different way. That's 
                         what Doctor Pal is here to do.  Unless, 
                         of course, you think we should take 
                         off our shirts and kiss.

                         N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt 
                         and kiss
 
                                     DOCTOR PAL
                         Well then to hell with you, kid. You 
                         can just deal with your problems on 
                         your own.

                         Next up for the talent show, put your 
                         hands together for the incredibly talented 
                         Jimmy Valmer!

                         Wow, what a what a great audience. So 
                         apparently Martha Stewart is out of 
                         jail. Have you have you heard about 
                         this, have you seen this? She's very 
                         excited to get started on her new show, 
                         "Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic 
                         ankle bracelet."  So it looks like the 
                         Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope. 
                         Have you seen this, have you heard about 
                         this?  A-a-apparently they're going 
                         to call him New Pope, a-and refer to

                         for the talent show.
 
                                     JIMMY
                         Butters, ah I really need to talk to 
                         somebody, and I think maybe you're the 
                         only person who won't make f-f-fun of 
                         me.

                         Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody 
                         with a problem.
 
                                     JIMMY
                         Butters, do you know what you're supposed 
                         to do when your penis gets hard?
 
                                     BUTTERS
                          Well sure I do.

                                     JIMMY
                         Really??

                                     BUTTERS
                         Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should 
                         have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, 
                         when a man's penis becomes hard, the 
                         man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina." 
                          Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside 
                         the lady's tummy, and after it's all 
                         done sneezin' milk.thepenis stops bein' 
                         hard, and the man loses interest in 
                         the lady.
 
                                     JIMMY
                         So, when your penis becomes hard, you're 
                         supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. 
                         And then it stops being hard?
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         That's right, Jimmy.

                                     JIMMY
                         But where am I going to find a lady 
                         to stick my penis in? The talent show 
                         is this Friday.

                         stick my penis in your vagina?

                         doing, man?
 
                                     JIMMY
                         I'm trying to get laid. What's it look 
                         like?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Dude, you don't just go up to a girl 
                         and ask her if you can stick your penis 
                         in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her 
                         on a date, take her out for some Italian 
                         food.
 
                                     JIMMY
                         Wow, seems like you know a lot about 
                         this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid 
                         before?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, 
                         like, five thousand times.
 
                                     JIMMY

                                     CARTMAN
                         I told you: a date and then Italian 
                         food. And then you gotta make her thnk 
                         you're a good listener.
 
                                     JIMMY
                         Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's 
                         very important that I score to-night! 
                         Can you come on the date and help me? 
                         You're like a white... Hitch.
 
                                     CARTMAN

                         in movies and TV shows. You go on the 
                         date and wear an earpiece, and I'll 
                         be nearby, secretly telling you all 
                         the right things to say.

                         it now!" because who wants a purse that 
                         both their best friends have, right?

                         say "Wow, I've never thought of it that 
                         way before, but you're right."

                         her trap again, I want you to repeat 
                         whatever she said, and then follow it

                         I don't need to be your friend."

                         "if you're gonna be that way, I don't 
                         need to be your friend." Wow, how insightful.

                         like you do.

                         because I really wanna stick my penis 
                         in your vagina.

                         it's been exactly two years since the 
                         fall of Baghdad. Have you seen this? 
                         Have you heard about this? Just as B-Bush 
                         predicted, Baghdad fell, Iraq fell, 
                         Saddam fell. The only thing that didn't 
                         fall was ...the price of gas.  I just 
                         read in the paper that China's protesting 
                         Japan. Have you seen this? Have you 
                         heard about this? Yeah, I guess in China 
                         you don't get to-  You've gotta be kidding 
                         me.
