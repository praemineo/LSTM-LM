                         says the only goal in this life is to 
                         praise God and get into heaven.

                         was a playful school-going eight-year-old. 
                         And then yesterday, he was  smacked 
                         down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped 
                         him right to the fiery depths of hell. 
                         So when will you go?! Tomorrow?! Ten 
                         years?! Does it mattah?! No! Because 
                         unless you give this life to the Lord, 
                         that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But 
                         we cannot worship God in that church 
                         where that priest of sin resides,  so 
                         we will build a new church-uh. With 
                         crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, 
                         and a slide that connects this part 
                         hmya  to this part hmya . Who will help 
                         us?

                         the smell is awful. He said that in

                         Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, 
                         but I must prepare for my next sermon.

                         doing. You need to tell all the kids 
                         to go back to school, and back to their

                         Heh-and now Chris and Saddam just keep 
                         killing each other over and over and... 
                         I don't know which one to pick.

                          Jesus, what the hell happened to you?
 
                         
                                     SATAN
                         Huh?

                                     GOD
                         You got kicked out of here for being 
                         a headstrong rebel. And now you're a 
                         whiny little bitch.
 
                                     SATAN
                         Well, I just don't know which one to 
                         pick.
 
                                     GOD
                         No, you've become dependent on relationships. 
                         So you haven't even considered the option 
                         of not being with either of them.  And 
                         if you're not sexually attracted to 
                         someone, you're not ever going to be. 
                         But Saddam isn't right either. He's 
                         the other extreme. You need to spend 
                         time alone so that you can find the 
                         balance, the middle ground. That's what 
                         I always do, because I'm a Buddhist.
 
                         
                                     SATAN
                         God, you're right. You know, I've had 
                         steady relationships for the last... thousand 
                         years, and when one ends I just start 
                         another one, but... I haven't taken the 
                         time to be secure with myself.
 
                                     GOD
                         Bingo. 

                                     SATAN
                         Hey- Thanks, God. I forgot how clear 
                         you make things sometimes.
 
                                     GOD
                         It was nice to see you again, Satan.

                         gotta go.

                         You're gonna send me to hell?

                         No. Worse!

               [Ensenada, Mexico, day. Mariachi music plays in the baackground. 
               A tour bus stops in front of Papas and Beer and drops Cartman 
               off, then pulls away.]

                          Aw, crap!

               [Hell, the park. Satan is strolling through the park in a happy 
               mood]

                          Hi, Bob. Hi, Rick.

                         Hi, Satan.

                                     SADDAM
                          There you are!

                                     SATAN
                          Awgh. Not again.

                                     SADDAM
                         You know you can't live without me. 
                         Now GET THAT ASS BACK TO BED!
 
                                     SATAN
                         Saddam, I told you: I don't need you 
                         anymore!
 
                                     SADDAM
                         You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves 
                         me.
 
                                     SATAN
                         Yes I can! Raaarrr 

                                     SADDAM
                         Aw, you little -prick!

                                     SATAN
                         Good-bye forever, Saddam!

                                     SADDAM
                          What are you talking about?! You can 
                         kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow.
 
                         
                                     SATAN
                         Not this time! I asked a favor of an 
                         old friend of mine to let you in!
 
                         
                                     SADDAM
                         Let me in where? 

               [Heaven, Saddam is whisked into it, as Satan was]

                                     SADDAM
                         What the? Hey, what the hell is this 
                         place?!
 
                                     MORMON 5
                         Hello, and welcome.

                                     MORMON 1
                         We're glad you made it, brother.

                                     SADDAM
                         Ey, who the hell are you?

                                     MORMON 6
                         We're just about to do a play, about 
                         how much stealing hurts you deep inside. 
                         Come join us. 
 
                                     MORMONS
                          Yes. Come on. Let's go.

                                     MORMON 6
                         You're here forever. 

                                     SADDAM
                         Nooo! Nu- nooooooooooo!
